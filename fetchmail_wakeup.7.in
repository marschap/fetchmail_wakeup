.SH NAME
fetchmail_wakeup \- Dovecot plugin to trigger fetchmail wakeups

.SH DESCRIPTION
fetchmail_wakeup is a plugin for Dovecot 1.1, 1.2 & 2.0.
Versions 1.1.x are intended to be used with dovecot 1.x,
while version 2.x are targetted towards Dovecot 2.0.
.PP
It intercepts the following IMAPv4 commands to fetch mail from the server:
.TP
.B STATUS
client polling for new mail
.TP
.B IDLE
client telling the server to push new mail
.TP
.B NOOP
client allows server to notify on new mail
.PP
and tries to wake up a running fetchmail daemon before performing
the command.
.PP
fetchmail_wakeup supports two different ways of waking up a fetchmail
daemon:
.TP 3
*
sending the SIGUSR1 signal to a PID stored in the first line of a PID file
.TP
*
executing a command
.PP
As both, the PID file and the command to execute, can be configured in
Dovecot's configuration file \fIdovecot.conf\fP, you are not restricted to
fetchmail, but can execute or send the SIGUSR1 signal to any command you want.


.SH CONFIGURATION
After the plugin library is installed and ready to be used, Dovecot's
configuration file, \fIDOVECOT_ETCDIR/dovecot.conf\fP, needs to be adapted
to make Dovecot use the plugin:

First, make Dovecot aware of the plugin.
This happens in dovecot.conf's \fBprotocol imap\fP section and comprises
.TP 3
*
setting the mail_plugin_dir variable (if not already set)
.TP
*
extending the mail_plugins variable by the plugin's name "fetchmail_wakeup"
.PP
.nf
\fBprotocol imap\fP {
    ...

    \fBmail_plugins\fP = \fBfetchmail_wakeup\fP
    \fBmail_plugin_dir\fP = DOVECOT_IMAP_MODULEDIR

    ...
}
.fi
.PP
Then, set the plugin's configuration options.
This is done in dovecot.conf's \fBplugin\fP section.

fetchmail_wakeup supports nine configuration options:
.TP
.BR fetchmail_interval = \fINUMBER\fP
Set global minimal interval between two fetchmail invocations
to \fINUMBER\fP seconds.
If it is not given, the interval defaults to \fB60\fP.
.TP
.BR fetchmail_interval_STATUS = \fINUMBER\fP
Set minimal interval between two fetchmail invocations for STATUS
to \fINUMBER\fP seconds.
If it is not given, the interval defaults to \fBfetchmail_interval\fP.
.TP
.BR fetchmail_interval_IDLE = \fINUMBER\fP
Set minimal interval between two fetchmail invocations for IDLE
to \fINUMBER\fP seconds.
If it is not given, the interval defaults to \fBfetchmail_interval\fP.
.TP
.BR fetchmail_interval_NOOP = \fINUMBER\fP
Set minimal interval between two fetchmail invocations for NOOP
to \fINUMBER\fP seconds.
If it is not given, the interval defaults to \fBfetchmail_interval\fP.
.TP
.BR fetchmail_helper = \fICOMMAND\fP
Execute \fICOMMAND\fP to either start fetchmail (or any other mail fetching tool),
or to awaken a running fetchmail daemon (or any other mail fetching tool).
By setting any of these to a very large value, you can virtually disable
triggering the plugin for the specific IMAP commands.
.TP
.BR fetchmail_pidfile = \fINAME\fP
Use \fINAME\fP as the file to read the process ID (PID) of a running fetchmail
instance from, and awaken this instance by sending it the \fBSIGUSR1\fP signal.
.PP
If fetchmail_helper is given, it takes precedence and fetchmail_pidfile
is ignored.
.PP
.nf
\fBplugin\fP {
    ...

    ## fetchmail_wakeup plugin: awaken fetchmail on IDLE, NOOP, & STATUS commands

    # minimal interval (in seconds) between two awakenings of fetchmail
    # (this setting is optional and defaults to 60)
    \fBfetchmail_interval\fP = 60

    # a helper program to notify fetchmail accordingly
    \fBfetchmail_helper\fP = BINDIR/awaken-fetchmail

    # pid file of a running fetchmail instance
    \fBfetchmail_pidfile\fP = %h/fetchmail.pid

    ...
}
.fi
.PP
As the example above shows, it is even possible to use Dovecot's variables
in the configuration options, and thus awaken the private fetchmail daemons
of multiple users with this configuration.
.PP
Now restart your dovecot daemon and enjoy the comfort of being able to control
fetchmail by simply fetching mail from the server in your IMAP client.


.SH ERRORS
fetchmail_wakeup reports its errors and warnings via Dovecot's regular logging
mechanisms.

.SH FILES
.I DOVECOT_ETCDIR/dovecot.conf

.SH NOTES
Although some kind of runtime-configurable rate-limiting is supported
using \fIfetchmail_interval\fP,
this module is not considered suitable for large scale installations.
But those installations do not rely on fetchmail for pulling in
new mail from mail providers anyway.
